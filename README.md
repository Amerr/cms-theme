# Clark Unibit Theme

### About Stackbit

[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) enables features like inline content editing, live previews and collaboration tools for Jamstack sites.

## Working with This Theme

This theme is written in [Unibit](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/), which is designed to transpile themes to work with multiple static site generators (SSG) such as Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby and Nextjs.

If you are looking to use this theme on a specific SSG, it is recommended that you use the Stackbit site builder to generate the theme. The site builder will generate the SSG-specific source to your own GitHub repository. You are free to use and modify the generated source however you wish.
